- Update tree-sitter locally to latest version
- Copy over `tree-sitter/lib/src/` and `tree-sitter/lib/include/`
- Update `Makevars` with new `OBJECTS`

# Manual code tweaks

Look for existing usage of `--- r-tree-sitter begin ---` and
`--- r-tree-sitter end ---` and ensure those are retained between version
bumps. In particular:

- Comment out usage of `stderr` and `abort()` in `alloc.c`, we provide our own
  allocators anyways.
- Comment out usage of `stderr` in `stack.c` in `ts_stack_print_dot_graph()`.
  We never expose a way to print the dot graph.
