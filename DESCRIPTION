Description: Provides bindings to tree-sitter, an incremental parsing
    system for programming tools. Tree-sitter builds concrete syntax trees
    for source files of any language, and can efficiently update those
    syntax trees as the source file is edited. It also includes a robust
    error recovery system that provides useful parse results even in the
    presence of syntax errors.
