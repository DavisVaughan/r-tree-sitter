Description: Provides bindings to 'Tree-sitter', an incremental parsing
    system for programming tools. 'Tree-sitter' builds concrete syntax
    trees for source files of any language, and can efficiently update
    those syntax trees as the source file is edited. It also includes a
    robust error recovery system that provides useful parse results even
    in the presence of syntax errors.
