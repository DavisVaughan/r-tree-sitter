# treesitter

<!-- badges: start -->

treesitter provides R bindings to [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter), an incremental parsing system. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. tree-sitter is useful for a number of things, including syntax highlighting, go-to definition, code reshaping, and more.

## Installation

You can install the development version of treesitter from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("DavisVaughan/r-tree-sitter")
```

This package does _not_ provide bindings to a language specific tree-sitter _grammar_. To fully utilize the treesitter package, you will also need to install a secondary grammar specific R package. Currently, there is just one, for R, at:

``` r
pak::pak("treesitter.r=r-lib/tree-sitter-r/bindings/r@next")
```

## Example

With treesitter, you can parse a string containing code for any language that you have a grammar for. Here's an example with R code:

```{r}
library(treesitter, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# Language specific grammars come from extension packages
language <- treesitter.r::language()
parser <- parser(language)

# Imagine this is a source document
text <- "
1 + 2
"

# Parse the text and display the resulting syntax tree
parser_parse(parser, text)
```

Syntax trees can get pretty complex, here's a larger example:

```{r}
text <- "
mtcars |>
  mutate(y = x + 1)
"

tree <- parser_parse(parser, text)
```

Trees and nodes have a pretty nice print method that colors matching parentheses and dims the locations. If you were to print out `tree` in your R console, here's what you'd see:

<img src="man/figures/README-dplyr-tree.png"/>

treesitter has a number of tools for navigating around and walking the tree:

```{r}
# The right hand side of the pipe
node <- tree |>
  tree_root_node() |>
  node_child(1) |>
  node_child_by_field_name("rhs")

node_text(node)
```

By default, printing a node in the tree will show both the _anonymous_ nodes and the _named_ nodes. Anonymous nodes help you see the full "concrete" syntax tree that tree-sitter builds. If you want to see something more akin to an abstract syntax tree, you can use `node_show_s_expression()`, which has a number of options for customizing the tree view:


```{r}
# Full detail
node_show_s_expression(node)

# Compact view, more like an AST
node_show_s_expression(
  node,
  show_anonymous = FALSE,
  show_locations = FALSE,
  dangling_parenthesis = FALSE
)
```
